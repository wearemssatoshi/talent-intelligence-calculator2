1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,660
Unfair voices cut deep inside.

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,240
Every smile, every tear turns to light,

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,880
I’ve seen the bottom, I’ve climbed back again,

4
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,680
Even through detours, I carry hope inside,

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,820
Every smile, every tear turns to light,

6
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:22,960
Every table tells a story of love.

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,500
To connect you all, to a radiant, shining future.

8
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,900
Every smile, every tear turns to light,

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,320
Every table tells a story of love.
