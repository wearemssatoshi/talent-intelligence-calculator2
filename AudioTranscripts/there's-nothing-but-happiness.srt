1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,400
Unfair voices cut deep inside.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,020
But I was watching, I still recall,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,720
Smiles of friends and regrets that stay with me all.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,620
Here, there’s nothing but happiness,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,280
Like a table set with love.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,800
Every smile, every tear turns to light,

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,520
This place is our true stage of life.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,040
I’ve seen the bottom, I’ve climbed back again,

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,680
With certain love, with uncertain days ahead.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,300
Even through detours, I carry hope inside,

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,520
And in that moment, the future shines with light.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,960
Here, there’s nothing but happiness,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,620
Like a table set with love.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,080
Every smile, every tear turns to light,

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,700
This place is our true stage of life.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,180
Even without a reply, you were by my side,

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,420
The mocked and troubled days shaped this life.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,980
So I’ll say it again, as many times as it takes:

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,220
On our stage, there’s only happiness—don’t you agree?

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,780
In this restaurant, nothing but happiness,

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,600
Every table tells a story of love.

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,940
Through the laughter and the tears we’ve shared,

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,820
This restaurant is our true stage of life.

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,240
Now I stand once more, with my friends I’ll win,

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,040
The world may run from tomorrow, blind with fear,

26
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,800
But we will keep building a stage that lasts a hundred years.

27
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,600
To connect you all, to a radiant, shining future.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,340
Here, there’s nothing but happiness,

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,980
Like a table set with love.

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,900
Every smile, every tear turns to light,

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,500
In this restaurant, nothing but happiness,

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,320
Every table tells a story of love.

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,660
Through the laughter and the tears we’ve shared,

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,560
This restaurant is our true stage of life
