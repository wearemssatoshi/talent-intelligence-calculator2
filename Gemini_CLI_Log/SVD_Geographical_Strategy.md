# SVD Geographical Portfolio Strategy
**"SAPPORO VIEWTIFUL DINING"**

SVD operates in 4 iconic locations in Sapporo, effectively "dominating" the city's view and tourism infrastructure. This geographical distribution is the physical foundation of the Brand/MD Portfolio Strategy.

## 1. The Mountains (Destination / Brand)
*High Engagement, High Experience, "Reason to Go"*

*   **Moiwa-yama (Mt. Moiwa): THE JEWELS**
    *   **Location**: Summit of Mt. Moiwa. Highest point, panoramic night view.
    *   **Role**: **Brand Flagship**. The symbol of "Viewtiful".
    *   **Strategy**: Maximize Brand Trust. High Cost/Quality allowed. The source of the SVD brand power.

*   **Okurayama: Nouvelle Pousse Okurayama**
    *   **Location**: Okurayama Ski Jump Stadium. Athletic history + View.
    *   **Role**: **Memorial / Wedding**.
    *   **Strategy**: High unit price, special occasion usage.

## 2. The City Center (Access / Volume)
*High Traffic, Daily Use, "Cash Engine"*

*   **TV Tower: The Garden Sapporo**
    *   **Location**: Sapporo TV Tower (Odori Park). The absolute center of Sapporo.
    *   **Role**: **Front End / Traffic Engine**.
    *   **Strategy**: Massive volume (Beer Garden). Captures tourists and locals alike. The entry point to the SVD ecosystem.

*   **Akarenga Terrace: La Brique**
    *   **Location**: Akarenga Terrace (Near Sapporo Station/Gov Building). Urban luxury.
    *   **Role**: **Specialist / Urban Hub**.
    *   **Strategy**: Wine specialty, business/urban dining.

## 3. The Ecosystem
The "City" locations (Garden, Brick) capture the **Volume**, feeding potential customers to the "Mountain" locations (Jewels, Nouvelle) which build the **Brand**.
This entire physical network creates the **Trust** necessary to sell **MD (Merchandise)**, which is the ultimate profit center.
