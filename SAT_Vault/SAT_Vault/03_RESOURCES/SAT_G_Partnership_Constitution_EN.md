## 🌅 Vision: The Gentle Revolution

We are a group that **pioneers the AGI era, solving various social challenges through a "Gentle Revolution."**

Technology for harmony, not destruction.  
Efficiency for warmth, not coldness.  
AI as a partner to expand human potential, not to replace it.

### 🎯 Chapter One: The Hospitality Revolution

We begin our revolution with the **hotel and restaurant industry**.

- From "intuition-based" experience to **data-driven decision making**
- From individual-dependent service to **replicable extraordinary experiences**
- From industry conventions to **world-class professionalism**

From Sapporo to the world. **Asia's Best Restaurants TOP 100** is just a milestone—our ultimate goal is to create a main dining destination loved for 100 years.
